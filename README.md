# ProductDetailApp
- ⚙️ Added support for multiple environments (Dev and Prod) with separate configuration files and display names.
- 🧱 Implemented a base MVVM architecture with centralized loading, error, and success handling (with tests).
- 🧭 Integrated the Coordinator pattern for structured navigation flow across modules.
- 📦 Implemented local JSON data handling with protocol-oriented architecture using Repository pattern.
- 🌐 Added a generic `NetworkErrors` enum with unified error management for both local and network requests.
- 🖼️ Introduced reusable UI components like `BaseImageView` and a circular countdown `CircularTimerView`.
- 🧩 Designed a scalable networking layer using `AppRequest` and `EndpointProtocol` with configurable environment-based endpoints (`AppServices`, `API`).
- 🧪 Injected mock vs real repositories dynamically via `ProviderFactory` based on environment, supporting both local and prod configurations.
- 🛠️ Implemented `BuildConfiguration` for safe, typed access to Info.plist environment values.
- 🧠 Applied Repository and Provider patterns for clean separation of concerns in data access (e.g. `ProductRepository`, `SocialProviderable`).
